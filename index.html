  *Extra Credit*

Add a way to filter the directory by name or username. To do this, you’ll need to request a random user nationality that will only return data in the English alphabet. Note: you don't have to rely on the API to return search results. You'll need to write functionality that filters results once they already on the page.
Add a way to move back and forth between employee detail windows when the modal window is open.
